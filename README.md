# LazyLoad

Download the project and run it in your browser.

The page loads initial 6 pictures on loading, and then when you're on the last picture loaded, it then loads the next set of pictures.
The pictures are set in a slide show and will move forward every 15 seconds. You can also navigate the pictures through the left and right buttons below the pictures.
